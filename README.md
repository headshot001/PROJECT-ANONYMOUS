# SOME COMMON PROBLEMS FACED WITH PROJECT ANONYMOUS :

**1) NET FLUCTUATES SOMETIMES DURING GAMEPLAY -** _THIS IS DUE TO AUTO DATA ON OFF FEATURE IMPLEMENTED INSIDE THE SCRIPT_

**2) SCRIPT TAKING LONG TIME TO TO LOAD -** _THIS IS BECAUSE OF YOUR NET SPEED/PING. THIS IS A ONLINE SCRIPT AND NEEDS A GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION_

**3) CAN'T LOGIN INTO GAME ACCOUNT -** _TRY CONNECTING A VPN AND THEN LOGIN TO YOUR ACCOUNT AFTER REACHING TO LOBBY THEN DISABLE THE VPN CONNECTION_

**4) WE ALLOW ACCESS TO ONLY 10 MEMBERS PER MONTH -** _BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT OUR HACK TO GET PATCHED SOON. OLD MEMBERS WILL BE GIVEN A LOWER PRIORITY THAN THE NEW MEMBERS_

**5) GAME CRASHES WHEN IT STARTS FROM ITS MINIMISED STATE(IN CASE OF PUBG) -** _PLAYERS ARE REQUESTED TO MINIMISE THEIR GAME MANUALLY WHEN THE GAME LOGO APPEARS(SEE BELOW IMAGE) AND RETURN TO TERMUX.DON'T WAIT FOR THE SCRIPT TO AUTOMATICALLY MINIMISE THE GAME AND RETURN TO TERMINAL_

**6) `system/etc/hosts` SHOWS READ-ONLY FILE SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THE SCRIPT IS RUNNING UNDER SUDO MODE -** _TO FIX THIS OPEN TERMUX AND TYPE `tsu mount -o rw,remount /system` AND HIT ENTER THEN AGAIN TYPE `mount -o rw,remount /system` AND HIT ENTER.THEN OPEN MT MANAGER AND GO TO `system/etc/hosts` LONG CLICK ON IT CLICK ON 3 DOTS ON THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER AND SELECT PERMISSION.THEN SET PERMISSION TO `644`.TO ASSURE THAT PERMISSION IS GIVEN TYPE `echo "hello" > /system/etc/hosts`.DO THIS EVERTIME BEFORE EXECUTING THE SCRIPT_
